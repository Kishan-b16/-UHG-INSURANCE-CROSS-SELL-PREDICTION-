 Problem Statement :
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) faces the challenge of optimizing cross-selling 
opportunities for additional insurance products among its customer base. To achieve 
this, UHG aims to predict customer behavior accurately regarding the purchase of 
supplementary insurance policies. The organization seeks to leverage its extensive 
dataset, including customer demographics, historical interactions, and existing 
insurance holdings, to develop predictive models capable of identifying customers 
most likely to respond positively to cross-selling efforts. 
The primary objective is to enhance customer retention, satisfaction, and revenue 
growth through targeted marketing strategies tailored to individual customer 
preferences and needs. By implementing advanced analytics and machine learning 
techniques, UHG aims to optimize resource allocation, improve operational efficiency, 
and drive business outcomes by effectively anticipating and meeting customer 
insurance needs. 
Key aspects of the problem include managing and analyzing large volumes of customer 
data, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulatory requirements, and 
overcoming challenges related to data quality and consistency. The project aims to 
enhance operational efficiency by optimizing resource allocation for marketing 
campaigns, improving customer retention rates through targeted engagement, and 
ultimately driving business growth by capitalizing on untapped cross-selling potentials.
